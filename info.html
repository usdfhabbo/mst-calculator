			<p>Before using this calculator to generate your report, it's important you  <a href="#check-some-things">Check Some Things</a> and Understand <a href="#how-to-use">How to Use</a> the calculator.</p>

      <h4>
      <a id="check-some-things" class="anchor" href="#check-some-things" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Check Some Things</h4>
    
      <p><strong>System Time</strong></p>
      <p>It's important to know that this calculator uses your systems time as a reference when checking MST.  For this reason, you need to ensure that your system time is correct.  You can check your system time by looking in the bottom right hand corner (if you're on a PC) or in the upper right hand corner (if on a Mac).  Ensure both the Date and Time are correct by comparing it to the time on your smartphone or by comparing it to an online time server, <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/" target="_blank">like this one</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Current MST Values</strong></p>
      <p>The next thing you need to check before generating your report is to ensure that the MST listing on the calculator are the same as the MST listing on Regulation 5. Here is a quick link to <a href="http://habbousdf.boards.net/thread/8/regulation-5-promotional-procedure-requirements" target="_blank">Regulation 5 - Promotional Procedure and Requirements</a>.</p>
      <p>The MST times that the calculator currently uses are on the table below. Compare this table to the one in Regulation 5.  <br><strong>If there are ANY differences, DO NOT USE THIS TO GENERATE YOUR REPORT. Contact McDigginit via Slack or a forum PM so the calculator can be updated ASAP</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Browser Requirements</strong></p>
      <p>In order for this calculator to work, your browser must have JavaScript enabled.  This application was originally only tested on Google Chrome but should work with the newest version of any modern browser.  Like anything else on the internet, IE is not recommended.</p>

     <h4><a id="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Use</h4>

     <p>Using the calculator is extremely simple and will greatly increase the efficiency and accuracy of your MST report.</p>
     <p>There are essentialy 3 different parts to the Calculator. Those being: <strong>Input Soldier Info</strong>, <strong>Preview</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong>. Each are explained in detail below.</p>

     <h5><strong>Input Soldier Info</strong></h5>
     <p>This section is where you will copy and paste the soldier's information from the PTS. Within this section, you'll find several text boxes and select menus which you will fill out for each individual soldier. The individual fields are:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Name</li>
       <li>Join Date</li>
       <li>Last Online</li>
       <li>Rank</li>
       <li>Duty Type</li>
     </ul>
    
    <p>It is very important that you copy and paste both the <strong>Name and Join Date</strong> from the PTS and <strong>do not type them in manually</strong>. This is to ensure that the name is spelled correctly. Also, the calculator can only properly calculate using the same date format as the PTS, so typing in something else may produce unexpected and inaccurate results.</p>

    <p><strong>Last Online</strong> must be pulled from within the Habbo client by searching each soldier's name individually.</p>

    <p><strong>Rank and Duty Type</strong> are both found on the PTS profile of each soldier.  If you cannot find a listed duty type, that soldier is Active Duty. The calculator automatically defaults to active duty.</p>

    <p>Once you've entered an individual soldier's info, the next two sections will automatically update themselves once you press the <strong>DO IT</strong> button.</p>

    <h5><strong>Preview</strong></h5>
    <p>The preview section simply shows the table contents that will be placed into your PM.  It's important to double check this as you're entering soldiers into your report.  If you make any errors, write them down and correct them in your PM later.<br>It's important to note that the header and other information is not included in the preview, but all code is provided for the BBCode section for you to copy and paste into your PM</p>

    <h5><strong>BBCode</strong></h5>
    <p>This is where the final, generated code will be placed. Just copy and paste all of the BBCode into a new PM (using the BBCode view) and then change to Preview mode and then update the information in the header with whatever applies to your report.</p>
			
    <p><strong>If you have any questions, comments or recommendations please send a forum PM or a slack DM to McDigginIt.</strong></p>
